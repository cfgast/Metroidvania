Implementation Notes
==============================================================================
This implementation plan contains a series of tasks. Each task should be picked up and implementated by an individual agent. Every Task contains the task description and if it has been implemented already. When an implementation is completed, change it to true. When implementations are updated, update any corresponding documentation. Also add new built files to .gitignore, and check in and push the new change to the remote along with the description of the change.

==============================================================================
Task: Create a GameObject that should be a generic object in game. You should be able to add components to a game object to give it additional functionality. To start we just want to create the basic movement component and rendering component which should be responsible for their indivdual parts.
Implemented: true

==============================================================================
Task: Create a basic map system, It should have defined areas that the player can walk on. It should understand where the player is on the map, and make sure that we draw that portion of the map on screen
Implemented: true

==============================================================================
Task: Create a basic starting map that has multiple platforms defined for the player to talk on
Implemented: true

==============================================================================
Task: Change the movement system so objects fall until they are on a walkable portion of the map, you can still move along those platforms with the controls
Implemented: true

==============================================================================
Task: Make sure the player starts on a walkable portion of the map so they don't fall. if the player falls off the map teleport them back to a valid location.
Implemented: true

==============================================================================
Task: Make is possible for the player to jump using the space bar key.
Implemented: true

==============================================================================
Task: Instead of harddcoding the platforms, make a map file format that describes the map, migrate the current map into the file, and then use the file to load the current map
Implemented: true
